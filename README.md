<h2>Team: ... </h2>
<ul>
    <li>Ipsita Purohit</li>
    <li>Kenway Tennant</li>
    <li>Tim Spendley</li>
</ul>

<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>{Put summary description here ... from Ispita's slide in deck}</p>

<h3>Questions / Tasks:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Is there a correlation between age of the patient and hypertension and heart disease? 
    <li>Is there a correlation between gender/sex of the patient and hypertension and heart disease? 
    <li>Find the correlation between bmi and blood_sugar level and whether a person is diabetic? 
    <li>What age group is diabetic (Create a bar chart for each age group)?
    <li>What age group suffers from heart disease and hypertension more? 
    <li>What's the correlation between HbA1c level and diabetes, heart disease and hypertension?
    <li>What's the correlation between smoking history and the three diseases? 
    <li>Compare census population data to the healthcare dataset (Using the census API for gender/age distribution).
</ol>

<h2>Data Sources</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Kaggle.com - Healthcare-Diabetes dataset (<a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nanditapore/healthcare-diabetes'>https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nanditapore/healthcare-diabetes</a>)
    <li>Census.gov API (<a href='https://www.census.gov/data/developers/about.html'>https://www.census.gov/data/developers/about.html</a>)
</ul>


<h2>Project Requirements</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Use Pandas to clean and format your dataset or datasets.</li>
    <li>Create a Jupyter notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process.</li>
    <li>Create a Jupyter notebook illustrating the final data analysis.</li>
    <li>Use Matplotlib to create 6 to 8 visualizations of your data
    (ideally, at least 2 visualizations per “question” that you ask your data).</li>
    <li>Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team—and for
    inclusion in your presentation.</li>
    <li>Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each “question”
    that you asked your data as well as a short description of your findings and any relevant plots.</li>
